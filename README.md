# CmdLineTicTacToe
One Python command line for 2 people to play Tic-Tac-Toe.
The game board can easily be extended up to a 10x10 by altering only the TTTBoard matrix (the list of lists in the first 5-ish lines).
Max size is 10x10 because what sane person plays any bigger board of Tic-Tac-Toe?
(also a three character input string instead of possibly more characters by an non-specific amount)
